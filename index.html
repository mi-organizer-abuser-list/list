    <h1>List of Abusers and Concerning People in Michigan</h1>
    <p>This list contains the names of known abusers, manipulators, and otherwise dangerous individuals, who are or were active in Michigan / Metro Detroit organizing groups OR are large names in Leftbook (not specific to Michigan). You may recognize them
        from multiple organizations, coalition work etc. This is no accident, as they have not been held accountable or begun to heal the damage they have caused, they change groups and hide in new spaces. This was collected by multitudes of people who
        have been harmed by them.</p>

    <p>As often as possible this list will be updated with available details, affiliated groups, and more names.</p>
    <p>If you would like to add to this list, please email here: <a href="mailto:miorganizerabuserlist@gmail.com">miorganizerabuserlist@gmail.com</a></p>
